# Uber_Supply_and_Demand_Gap_Analysis
The analysis identified the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) in uber data and recommend ways to improve the situation.
 We might have face the problem of cancellation by
the driver or non-availability of cars during cab booking. These are the problems faced by customers, these very issues impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its
revenue.
  The problem Uber is facing is addressed- driver cancellation and
non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue.
1)Data Cleaning and Preparation
     a) Identified the data quality issues identified and cleaned the data
     b) Dates and time format is set for time date column. Derived new variables which will be useful for analysis.                             
2)Data Visualisation 
     a) Created plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or
          show 'no cars available'; 
     b) Identified  the most problematic types of requests (city to
         airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.)
         using plots
3) The gap between supply and demand are shown using plots.
4) Recommendations
